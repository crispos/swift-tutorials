//: ## Calculations
//: You can use a playground like a calculator. Type in the math problem you want solved and the results sidebar shows the answer, or the _result_, of the calculation.
//:
//: You can use the plus `+` and minus `-` signs for addition and subtraction, just as youâ€™d expect:
34 + 56 + 230
23 + 562
1000 - 300
758 + 52
//: For multiplication, use the asterisk `*` :
3 * 100
4 * 40
128 * 64
12 * 82
//: For division, use the slash `/` :
24 / 8
36 / 2
48 / 6
125 / 25
//: For grouping, use parenthesis `( )` :
(300 + 500 + 400) / 3
(250 + 400) / 42
(1200 + 88) / 2
//: - experiment:\
//: Practice using the playground like a calculator.
//: Edit some of the existing expressions and add a few of your own.
//: Notice that every time you make a change the results are updated in the sidebar.
//:
//: Next, learn how programmers can leave notes in code.
