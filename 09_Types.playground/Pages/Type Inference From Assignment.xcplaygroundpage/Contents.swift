let string = 42

let anotherString = string
/*:
 In this example, `string` is of type `String` because it is created from a literal. And `anotherString` is also of type `String`, because it is created from a `String`.
 
 - experiment: Change `"42"` to `42`. What type will `anotherString` have now?\
(Hint: Check the type by holding down the `Option` key while clicking the `anotherString` constant.)

Next, find out what to do when type inference doesnâ€™t work.
