 ## Exercise: Using Return Values
 
 You’ve learned that functions are the building blocks of programs, but so far you’ve mostly used functions one at a time. In this exercise, you'll use the results of one function to influence the work that's done by another.

 The function `impossibleBeliefsCount` takes several numbers of reported unlikely incidents. It then prints the number of impossible things to be believed:
*/
func impossibleBeliefsCount(pigsFlying: Int, frogsBecomingPrinces: Int, multipleLightningStrikes: Int) -> Int {
    let total = pigsFlying + frogsBecomingPrinces + multipleLightningStrikes
    print(total)
    return total
}

//: - callout(Exercise):Update the `impossibleBeliefsCount` function so that instead of printing the value, it returns it as an `Int`.
//:
//: `impossibleThingsPhrase` creates a phrase using string interpolation:
func impossibleThingsPhrase(numberOfImpossibleThings: Int, meal: String) -> String {
    let numberOfImpossibleThings = 10
    let meal = "teatime"
    return "Why, I've believed as many as \(numberOfImpossibleThings) before \(meal)"
}

let impossibleBeliefTotal = impossibleBeliefsCount
