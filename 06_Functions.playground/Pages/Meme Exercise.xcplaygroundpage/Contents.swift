 ## Functional Meme
 
 Think of a fun song or meme that you've heard or seen recently. Try to think of one with repetitive parts. For example:
 
 - A song with a repeated chorus.
 - A meme that repeats a word or phrase.
 - A song that repeats a line over and over.
 
 Write out the song or meme using `print` statements, then look for patterns and repetition and choose groups of lines to combine into functions. This is a free-form exercise, so you can do whatever you like.
